Background:

Today, we live in a consumer culture like no other, where ownership is as common and taken for granted as the air we breathe. But must one own everything? Can't one just borrow when needed and return when done?

A new phenomenon that has emerged in the wake of environmental and consumption debates is libraries of various kinds. Not just books.

The homeowners' association Stickan has noticed that many residents in their townhouse community have various projects underway. These range from indoor renovations to outdoor deck constructions. However, many lack the tools needed, and there is constant inquiry about drills and jigsaws. A decision at the latest board meeting was for the homeowners' association to establish a small tool library with tools that most people don't use daily but are very useful for renovation and construction projects.

Task:

Since it is 2024, such a place must have a lending system. As an expert in app development, you have been contacted by the homeowners' association Stickan to develop this for them. As a developer in tune with the current situation, you naturally start with a thorough mockup and prototype to be tested on the residents in Stickan's area to refine it into a user-friendly masterpiece.

The system should be mobile-friendly. Desktop is not relevant at the moment.

They also wish for the pages to be made in HTML and CSS (no JavaScript needed but can be added if desired). This means that they will be static pages that are the same as those you have designed in Figma. All text can be lorem ipsum.

Functional Requirements:

  <li>Select a tool from a list</li>
  <li>Rent them > receipt / confirmation</li>
  <li>There is only one tool of each available for lending.</li>
  <li>It should be possible to see if a tool is already on loan.</li>
  <li>Overview of loans and return times</li>

Design Requirements:

  <li>Clarity should be the focus.</li>
  <li>The target audience is middle-aged and older.</li>
  <li>There should be a design system (i.e., components such as input fields, buttons, some colors, and maximum two fonts, and this design system should be used on the website). Example for inspiration: https://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns/color</li>

The intention is to be somewhat ambiguous and something to ponder and discuss. The idea is also for you to practice handling requirements/requests that can be interpreted in different ways.

Figma Requirements:

It should be an interactive prototype in Figma.

It should include:

  <li>Color styles</li>
  <li>Text styles</li>
  <li>Grid styles</li>
  <li>Components</li>

Technical Requirements:

  <li>The website should use the same grid system.</li>
  <li>There should be a design system (i.e., components such as input fields, buttons, some colors, and maximum two fonts, and this design system should be used on the website). Example for inspiration: https://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns/color</li>
  <li>It should be component-based, meaning there should be a CSS file with component classes to be used for the pages according to the above specifications.</li>
  <li>The pages implemented in HTML/CSS.</li>
